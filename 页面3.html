    <p>
        Any equitable method for determining which team or player will serve first and which side of the net each team or player will be on is acceptable.

    <h2>Announcing the score and serving</h2>

    <img src="./image/2.png" alt="图片描述"width="550" height="625"style="display:inline-block;"></div>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">serve in            &              serve out</p>
    <p>
        The score is announced before each serve by the official overseeing the match. If a match is not officiated, the server announces the score.
    </p>
    <h3>Doubles:</h3>
        <p>The score has three parts; the serving team’s score, the receiving team’s score, and the server number, a "1" or "2" that indicates whether the server is the serving team′s first or second server. The first server of the game is always considered the serving team's second server and may call the server number "start" or "2". The starting score in doubles is announced as "zero zero two".
</p>
    <h3>Singles:</h3>
        <p>
        The score only has two parts; the serving player's score and the receiving player′s score. The starting score in singles is always announced as "zero zero".
   </p>
     <p>
        The first starting server of the game initiates the first serve of the game from their team's right service court, also called the even service court. Serves are always served to the diagonal crosscourt of their opponent. The diagonal crosscourt of one team's right service court is also the other team's right service court. The converse is true for the left, or odd, service court.
    </p>
        <h2>Two-bounce Rule</h2>
    <p>A serve must land in the diagonal service court on the opponent's side of the net (see "service in" diagram). The serve receiver must allow the ball to bounce once before returning the ball to the server′s side of the net. Once the receiver has returned the ball over the net, the serving side must also allow the ball to bounce once before returning the ball to the non-serving side. This is known as the two-bounce rule.
    </p>
    <p>After the first two returns, either side may volley the ball—that is, return it before it bounces. The ball can never bounce more than once before it is returned. No player may volley the ball while standing in the non-volley zone or touching any of the lines around the non-volley zone.
    </p>
        <h2>Remainder of Play</h2>
    <p>A server continues to serve, alternating between the right and left service courts until their team commits a fault.
    </p>
        <h3>Doubles:</h3>
        <p>
         At the beginning of a doubles game, the side serving first is only allowed one fault before their side is "out", called a side–out, and the serve passes to their opponent. After the first side–out of the game, each team is allowed two faults before a side-out is called, allowing each of the players on a doubles team to serve before the serve passes to the other team. A team's second server must continue alternating between the right and left service courts from wherever their partner left off. For example, if their partner's last serve was from the right service court, the second server must start serving on the left service court. After a side–out, the first serve is always initiated from the right serving area.
    </p>
        <h3>Singles: </h3>
        <p>A side-out is called each time the serving side commits a fault. If the serving player's score is zero or even, they must serve from the right, or even, service court; otherwise, they must serve from the left, or odd, service court. Depending on the current score, the first serve after a side-out can be from either the right or left service court.</p>
    <p>The first side scoring 11 points, leading by at least two points, wins the game. Tournament games may be played to 11, 15 or 21 points with players rotating sides at 6, 8 or 11 total points respectively.</p>
